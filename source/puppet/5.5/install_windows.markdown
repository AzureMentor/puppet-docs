Install the Puppet agent so that your master can communicate with your Windows nodes.

**Before you begin:** If you're using Puppet with a master-agent configuration, you'll need a \*nix node to act as your Puppet master. Read the [pre-install tasks.](./install_pre.html)

1. Download the Windows `puppet-agent` package

   [Puppet's Windows packages can be found here.][downloads] You need the most recent package for your OS's architecture:

   * 64-bit versions of Windows must use `puppet-agent-<VERSION>-x64.msi`.
   * 32-bit versions of Windows must use `puppet-agent-<VERSION>-x86.msi`.

   >**Note:** Puppet agent will prevent you from running the 32-bit version on a 64-bit Windows system, this functionality was deprecated in Puppet 4, and removed in Puppet 5.

   These packages bundle all of Puppet's prerequisites, so you don't need to download anything else.

   The list of Windows packages might include release candidates, whose filenames have something like `-rc1` after the version number. Use these only if you want to test upcoming Puppet versions.

   >**Note:** Puppet dual-signs `puppet-agent` packages. You might see a warning from your browser saying the signature is corrupt or invalid.

   >
   > If you want to verify the package is dual-signed, right-click on the MSI, and select **Properties**. Navigate to the **Digital Signatures** tab and you should see something similar to:

2. Install Puppet

   You can install Puppet [with a graphical wizard](#graphical-installation) or [on the command line](#automated-installation). The command-line installer provides more configuration options.

   **Graphical installation:**

[server]: ./images/wizard_server.png

   1. Double-click the MSI package you downloaded, and follow the graphical wizard. The installer must be run with elevated privileges. Installing Puppet does not require a system reboot.

   2. During installation, Puppet asks you for the hostname of your Puppet master server. This must be a \*nix node configured to act as a Puppet master.

      For standalone Puppet nodes that won't connect to a master, use the default hostname (`puppet`). You might also want to install on the command line and set the agent startup mode to `Disabled`.

      ![Puppet master hostname selection][server]

   Once the installer finishes, Puppet will be installed, running, and partially configured.

   **Automated installation:**

   1. Use the `msiexec` command to install the Puppet package.

      `msiexec /qn /norestart /i puppet-agent-<VERSION>-x64.msi`

      If you don't specify any further options, this is the same as installing graphically with the default Puppet master hostname (`puppet`).

      Optionally, you can specify `/l*v install.txt` to log the installation's progress to a file.

	  You can also set several MSI properties to pre-configure Puppet as you install it. For example:

      `msiexec /qn /norestart /i puppet-agent-<VERSION>-x64.msi PUPPET_MASTER_SERVER=puppet.example.com`

      See [the MSI Properties section](#msi-properties) for information about these MSI properties.

      Once the installer finishes, Puppet will be installed, running, and partially configured.

## MSI properties

These options are only available when installing Puppet on the command line.

### `INSTALLDIR`

Specifies where Puppet and its dependencies should be installed.

> If you installed Puppet into a custom directory and are upgrading from a 32-bit version to a 64-bit version, you must re-specify the `INSTALLDIR` option when upgrading.
>
> If you are replacing 64-bit Puppet with a 32-bit version, you should **uninstall** Puppet before installing the new package. Be sure to re-specify any relevant MSI properties when re-installing.

Puppet's program directory contains the following subdirectories:

Directory   | Description
------------|------------
bin         | scripts for running Puppet and Facter
facter      | Facter source
hiera       | Hiera source
mcollective | MCollective source
misc        | resources
puppet      | Puppet source
service     | code to run puppet agent as a service
sys         | Ruby and other tools

**Default:**

When using the architecture-appropriate installer, Puppet installs into `C:\Program Files\Puppet Labs\Puppet`.

### `PUPPET_MASTER_SERVER`

The hostname where the Puppet master server can be reached. This sets a value for the `server` setting in the `[main]` section of `puppet.conf`. **Default:** `puppet`

> **Note:** If you set a _non-default_ value for this property, the installer **replaces** any existing value in puppet.conf. Also, the next time you upgrade, the installer re-uses your previous value for this property unless you set a new value on the command line. So if you've used this property once, you shouldn't change the `server` setting directly in puppet.conf; you should re-run the installer and set a new value there instead.

### `PUPPET_CA_SERVER`

The hostname where the CA Puppet master server can be reached, if you are using multiple masters and only one of them is acting as the CA. This sets a value for the `ca_server` setting in the `[main]` section of `puppet.conf`. **Default:** The value of the `PUPPET_MASTER_SERVER` property.

> **Note:** If you set a _non-default_ value for this property, the installer **replace** any existing value in `puppet.conf`. Also, the next time you upgrade, the installer re-uses your previous value for this property unless you set a new value on the command line. So if you've used this property once, you shouldn't change the `ca_server` setting directly in `puppet.conf`; you should re-run the installer and set a new value there instead.

### `PUPPET_AGENT_CERTNAME`

The node's certificate name, and the name it uses when requesting catalogs. This sets a value for the `certname` setting in the `[main]` section of `puppet.conf`. For best compatibility, you should limit the value of `certname` to only use lowercase letters, numbers, periods, underscores, and dashes. (That is, it should match `/\A[a-z0-9._-]+\Z/`.) **Default:** the node's fully-qualified domain name, as discovered by `facter fqdn`.

> **Note:** If you set a _non-default_ value for this property, the installer **replaces** any existing value in `puppet.conf`. Also, the next time you upgrade, the installer re-uses your previous value for this property unless you set a new value on the command line. So if you've used this property once, you shouldn't change the `certname` setting directly in `puppet.conf`; you should re-run the installer and set a new value there instead.

### `PUPPET_AGENT_ENVIRONMENT`

The node's environment. This sets a value for the `environment` setting in the `[main]` section of puppet.conf.

**Default:** `production`

> **Note:** If you set a _non-default_ value for this property, the installer **replaces** any existing value in `puppet.conf`. Also, the next time you upgrade, the installer re-uses your previous value for this property unless you set a new value on the command line. So if you've used this property once, you shouldn't change the `environment` setting directly in `puppet.conf`; you should re-run the installer and set a new value there instead.

### `PUPPET_AGENT_STARTUP_MODE`

Whether the Puppet agent service should run (or be allowed to run). Allowed values:

* `Automatic` (**default**) --- Puppet agent starts with Windows and stays running in the background.
* `Manual` --- Puppet agent won't run by default, but can be started in the services console or with `net start` on the command line.
* `Disabled` --- Puppet agent is installed but disabled. You must change its startup type in the services console before you can start the service.

### `PUPPET_AGENT_ACCOUNT_USER`

Which Windows user account the Puppet agent service should use. This is important if the Puppet agent needs to access files on UNC shares, since the default `LocalSystem` account cannot access these network resources.

* This user account **must already exist,** and can be a local or domain user. (The installer allows domain users even if they haven't accessed this machine before.)
* If the user isn't already a local administrator, the installer adds it to the `Administrators` group.
* The installer also grants the [`Logon as Service`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms813948.aspx) privilege to the user.

This property should be combined with `PUPPET_AGENT_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD` and `PUPPET_AGENT_ACCOUNT_DOMAIN`. For example, to assign the agent to a domain user `ExampleCorp\bob`, install with:

`msiexec /qn /norestart /i puppet-agent-<VERSION>-x64.msi PUPPET_AGENT_ACCOUNT_DOMAIN=ExampleCorp PUPPET_AGENT_ACCOUNT_USER=bob PUPPET_AGENT_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD=password`

**Default:** `LocalSystem`

### `PUPPET_AGENT_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD`

The password to use for the Puppet agent's user account. See the notes under [`PUPPET_AGENT_ACCOUNT_USER`](#puppetagentaccountuser).

**Default:** no value.

### `PUPPET_AGENT_ACCOUNT_DOMAIN`

The domain of the Puppet agent's user account. See the notes under [`PUPPET_AGENT_ACCOUNT_USER`](#puppetagentaccountuser).

**Default:** `.`

## Downgrade from 64-bit Puppet to 32-bit Puppet

If you need to replace a 64-bit version of Puppet with a 32-bit version, you must **uninstall** Puppet before installing the new package.

You can uninstall Puppet through the "Add or Remove Programs" interface or from the command line.

To uninstall Puppet from the command line, you must have the original MSI file or know the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa370854(v=vs.85).aspx">ProductCode</a> of the installed MSI:

    msiexec /qn /norestart /x puppet-agent-1.3.0-x64.msi
    msiexec /qn /norestart /x <PRODUCT CODE>

When you uninstall Puppet, the uninstaller removes Puppet's program directory, the Puppet Agent services, and all related registry keys. It leaves the [`$confdir`](./dirs_confdir.html), [`$codedir`](./dirs_codedir.html), and [`$vardir`](./dirs_vardir.html) intact, including any SSL keys. To completely remove Puppet from the system, manually delete the `$confdir`, `$codedir`, and `$vardir`.

## Upgrade from 32-bit Puppet to 64-bit Puppet on Windows

The easiest migration path to upgrade is to compensate for redirection, using the `$system32` fact,  available in [Puppet 3.7.3](https://docs.puppet.com/puppet/3.7/release_notes.html#puppet-373) and later. This fact automatically compensates for file system redirection. You need to ensure any manifests also use this fact, and that any modules you are using are not affected by redirection. The best way to do this is to check the READMEs for the module.

The installer specifically stores information in different areas of the registry to allow rolling back to the 32bit agent.

For more information, see [compensating for redirection](./lang_windows_file_paths.html#compensating-for-redirection).
