As known issues are discovered in Puppet 6.0 and its patch releases, they'll be added here. Once a known issue is resolved, it is listed as a resolved issue in the release notes for that release, and removed from this list.

### Puppet 6.0.1

- We did not quite finish the support for the `Binary` data type in time for 6.0.0. Before you start to use `Binary` in your manifests for anything except `File` content, you should be aware of the ticket [PUP-9110](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-9110), as it could introduce changes that may affect you. ([PUP-9110](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-9110))


### Puppet 6.0

- We are no longer deprecating CA-related settings (see PUP-9027 for list of settings that were deprecated and are being undeprecated). We are no longer removing these settings in Puppet 6. ([PUP-9116](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-9116))
