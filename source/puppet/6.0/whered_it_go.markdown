In Puppet 4.0, we changed the locations of a lot of important config files and directories. We also changed Puppet's packaging to install different things in different places.

This page is a summary, to quickly orient users arriving from Puppet 3.

> For details, [we've written a specification of the directories used by all of Puppet's tools.][spec]

## New all-in-one `puppet-agent` package

On managed \*nix systems, install `puppet-agent` instead of `puppet`. (This package also provides `puppet apply`, suitable for standalone Puppet systems.)

This is a new name for a new thing. Instead of using package dependencies to bring in tools like Facter, Hiera, and Ruby, it includes private versions of all of them. 

On Windows, use the same package as before. 

## \*nix executables are in `/opt/puppetlabs/bin/`

On \*nix platforms, the main executables moved to `/opt/puppetlabs/bin`. This means **Puppet and related tools aren't included in your PATH by default.** You'll need to either:

-   Add `/opt/puppetlabs/bin` to your PATH
-   Symlink Puppet's tools to somewhere else in your PATH
-   Use the full path (like `/opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet apply` when running Puppet commands

On Windows, executables stayed in the same location, and the MSI package still adds Puppet's tools to the PATH.

### Private `bin` directories

The executables in `/opt/puppetlabs/bin` are just the "public" applications that make up Puppet. Private supporting commands like `ruby` and `gem` are in `/opt/puppetlabs/puppet/bin`, to keep them from accidentally overriding system tools if you add the public bin dir to your PATH.

## \*nix `confdir` is now `/etc/puppetlabs/puppet`

Puppet's system [`confdir`][confdir] (used by `root` and the `puppet` user) is now `/etc/puppetlabs/puppet`, instead of `/etc/puppet`. Open source Puppet 4.0 and newer use the same `confdir` as Puppet Enterprise.

The [`confdir`][confdir] is the directory that holds config files like `puppet.conf` and `auth.conf`.

On Windows, this stayed the same. It's still in the `COMMON_APPDATA` folder, defaulting to `C:\ProgramData\PuppetLabs\puppet\etc` on modern Windows versions.

### `ssldir` is inside `confdir`

On some Linux distros, our default config in Puppet 3.x set Puppet's `ssldir` as `$vardir/ssl` instead of `$confdir/ssl`. Since Puppet 4.x, the default location is in the `confdir` on all platforms.

### Other configurations in `/etc/puppetlabs`

Other related configurations were also moved into the `/etc/puppetlabs` directory in Puppet 4.0. Puppet Server now uses `/etc/puppetlabs/puppetserver`.

## New `codedir` holds all modules, manifests, and data

All of the content that Puppet uses to configure nodes was moved into a new directory, named `codedir`. In Puppet 3.x, this content was in the `confdir`.

The default `codedir` location is:

-   `/etc/puppetlabs/code` on \*nix
-   `C:\ProgramData\PuppetLabs\code` on Windows
-   `<USER DIRECTORY>/.puppetlabs/etc/code` if you're running as a non-root user

The main contents of the `codedir` are:

-   The `environments` directory.
-   The global `modules` directory. Use this location only for modules you want deployed in _all_ environments.
-   The `hiera.yaml` config file.

### Directory environments are always enabled

Since Puppet 4.0, [directory environments][] are always enabled.

The default `environmentpath` is `$codedir/environments`. Upon installation, Puppet creates a directory for the default `production` environment.

If you're starting from scratch:

-   Put modules in `$codedir/environments/production/modules`.
-   Put your [main manifest][] in `$codedir/environments/production/manifests`.

You can still put global modules in `$codedir/modules`, and can configure a global [main manifest][] with the `default_manifest` setting.

### Hiera data goes in environments by default

Hiera's default settings now use an environment-specific datadir for the YAML and JSON backends. For example, the `production` environment's default Hiera data directory would be `/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/hieradata`.

## Some other directories have moved

-   The system `vardir` for `puppet agent` has moved, and is now separate from Puppet Server's `vardir`.
    -   On \*nix: `/opt/puppetlabs/puppet/cache`
    -   On Windows: `C:\ProgramData\PuppetLabs\puppet\cache`
-   The `rundir`, where the service PID files go, has moved:
    -   On \*nix: `/var/run/puppetlabs`. (Puppet Server has a `puppetserver` directory in this directory.)
    -   On Windows: `C:\ProgramData\PuppetLabs\puppet\var\run` --- this is the same as before, but it's now outside the main `vardir`.
